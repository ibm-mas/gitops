# gitops

A GitOps approach to managing Maximo Application Suite.

## Overview

### Architecture

The **Source Git Repo** provides Helm Charts that define all of the Kubernetes resources required to deploy MAS instances using ArgoCD. This is the [ibm-mas/gitops](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops) repository, or it can be a custom fork if necessary,

The **Config Git Repo** provides configuration YAML files that define the Values for rendering the Helm Charts in the **Source Git Repo**. The  **Config Git Repo** defines how many MAS instances will be deployed and where and how each of the MAS instances are configured.
The **Secrets Vault** is used to store sensitive values that should not be exposed in the **Source Git Repo**. They are fetched at runtime using the [ArgoCD Vault Plugin](https://argocd-vault-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) from some _Secrets Vault_ implementation (e.g. AWS Secrets Manager). 


ArgoCD, running on some _Management Cluster_ obtains the MAS GitOps Helm charts from some _Source Git Repo_ (i.e. [ibm-mas/gitops](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops)).  Secret values (which must be stored securely and not exposed in the _Config Git Repo_) are fetched using

### Application Structure

The **Account Root Application** is created in ArgoCD to bootstrap the process. This is the only ArgoCD application that is directly created, all other applications are generated by ArgoCD following the [App of Apps pattern](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/cluster-bootstrapping/#app-of-apps-pattern). It serves as the "entry point" to provide various global configuration parameters and to kick off the process of generating ArgoCD Applications to deploy and manage MAS resources on a set of target OCP clusters for a particular "account" (e.g. "dev", "staging", "prod") via ArgoCD. The structure of the manifest for the Account Root Application, along with full list of parameters is given in the gitops [README](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/README.md).

The following figure shows the generated tree of ArgoCD applications (and ApplicationSets), starting with the **Account Root Application** at the top:

![Application Structure](docs/png/appstructure.png)


The **Account Root Application** [Helm Chart]((https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/tree/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-account-root)) installs the **[Cluster Root Application Set](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/tree/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-account-root/templates/000-cluster-appset.yaml)**. This generates a set of **MAS Cluster Root Applications** based on the configuration in the _config_ Git repo. 

The **Cluster Root Application** [Helm Chart](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/tree/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-cluster-root) contains templates that generate ArgoCD Applications for configuring various cluster-wide dependencies required by MAS instances on the target cluster, including:

- [Operator Catalog](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-cluster-root/templates/000-ibm-operator-catalog-app.yaml) ([Helm Chart](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/cluster-applications/))
- [Redhat Certificate Manager](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-cluster-root/templates/010-ibm-redhat-cert-manager-app.yaml) ([Helm Chart](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/cluster-applications/010-redhat-cert-manager))
- [DRO](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-cluster-root/templates/010-ibm-dro-app.yaml) ([Helm Chart](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/cluster-applications/020-ibm-dro))

- [Nvidia GPU Operator](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-cluster-root/templates/050-nvidia-gpu-operator-app) ([Helm Chart](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/cluster-applications/050-nvidia-gpu-operator))


The **Cluster Root Application** [Helm Chart](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/tree/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-cluster-root) also installs the **[MAS Instance Root Application Set](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-cluster-root/templates/099-instance-appset.yaml)**. This generates a set of **MAS Instance Root Applications** based on the configuration in the _config_ Git repo.  

The **MAS Instance Root Application** [Helm Chart](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/tree/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root) contains templates for generating ArgoCD Applications that install and configure some instance-level dependencies (e.g. SLS, DB2 Databases), MAS Core and various (MAS) applications (e.g. Manage, Monitor, etc) in the appropriate namespace on the target cluster:
 
- [CP4D](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root/templates/080-ibm-cp4d.yaml) ([Helm Chart](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/instance-applications/080-ibm-cp4d))
- [Suite License Service](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root/templates/100-ibm-sls-app.yaml) ([Helm Chart](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/instance-applications/100-ibm-sls))
- [MAS Suite](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root/templates/130-ibm-mas-suite-app.yaml) ([Helm Chart](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/instance-applications/130-ibm-mas-suite))
- [MAS App Assist Install](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root/templates/500-ibm-mas-masapp-assist-install.yaml) ([Helm Chart](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/instance-applications/500-540-ibm-mas-suite-app-install))

- [MAS App VisualInspection Install](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root/templates/500-ibm-mas-masapp-visualinspection-install.yaml) ([Helm Chart](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/instance-applications/500-540-ibm-mas-suite-app-install))
- [MAS App Health Install](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root/templates/520-ibm-mas-masapp-health-install.yaml) ([Helm Chart](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/instance-applications/500-540-ibm-mas-suite-app-install))
- [MAS App Monitor Install](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root/templates/520-ibm-mas-masapp-monitor-install.yaml) ([Helm Chart](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/instance-applications/500-540-ibm-mas-suite-app-install))
- [MAS App Optimizer Install](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root/templates/520-ibm-mas-masapp-optimizer-install.yaml) ([Helm Chart](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/instance-applications/500-540-ibm-mas-suite-app-install))
- [MAS App Predict Install](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root/templates/540-ibm-mas-masapp-predict-install.yaml) ([Helm Chart](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/instance-applications/500-540-ibm-mas-suite-app-install))


There are some special templates in the **MAS Instance Root Application** [Helm Chart](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/tree/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root) that are capable of generating multiple Applications; necessary when there may be one or more instances of that type of resource, which will vary between MAS instances - for instance DB2 databases, suite configs, and suite/application workspaces:

- [DB2 Databases](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root/templates/120-db2-databases-app.yaml) ([Helm Chart](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/instance-applications/120-ibm-db2u-database))
- [MAS Workspaces](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root/templates/200-ibm-mas-workspaces.yaml) ([Helm Chart](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/instance-applications/220-ibm-mas-workspace))
- [MAS App Configs](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root/templates/510-550-ibm-mas-masapp-configs) ([Helm Chart](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/instance-applications/510-550-ibm-mas-suite-app-config))
- [Suite Configs](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root/templates/130-ibm-mas-suite-configs-app.yaml)
  - This application is responsible for installing various types of suite configuration types (Mongo, BAS, SMTP, etc) at various scopes (system, app, ws, wsapp). The Helm Chart it uses is chosen dynanmically based on the configuration type:
    - [JDBC Config](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root/templates/130-ibm-db2u-jdbc-config)
    - [Kafka Config](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root/templates/130-ibm-kafka-config)
    - [BAS Config](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root/templates/130-ibm-mas-bas-config)
    - [IDP Config](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root/templates/130-ibm-mas-idp-config)
    - [Mongo Config](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root/templates/130-ibm-mas-mongo-config)
    - [SLS Config](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root/templates/130-ibm-mas-sls-config)
    - [SMTP Config](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root/templates/130-ibm-mas-smtp-config)
    - [COS Config](https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops/blob/demo2/root-applications/ibm-mas-instance-root/templates/130-ibm-objectstorage-config)


>  **Why not use Application Sets here?** We encountered some limitations when using Application Sets for this purpose. For instance, Applications generated by Application Sets are children of the *Application Set*, and are not direct children of the parent Application. This means that they do not participate in the [ArgoCD syncwave](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-waves/) of the parent Application, so we would have no way of ensuring that resources would be configured in the correct order. Instead, we make use of the Helm `range` control structure in the Helm template to dynamically generate applications that are direct children of the parent application. 


### Config Git Repository Structure

The _Config_ Git repository represents the "source of truth" that (along with the Charts in the _Source Git Repo_ and the secrets in the _Secrets Vault_) provides everything ArgoCD needs to install and manage MAS instances across the target clusters. Configuration is structured as a hierarchy; with "accounts" (e.g. dev/prod/staging) at the top, followed by "clusters", followed by "instances". 

Each account is managed by its own ArgoCD instance containing a single **Account Root Application**. 

> **Why can't a single ArgoCD instance contain more than one Account Root Application?** This is primarily due to a limitation we have inherited to be compatible with internal IBM systems where we must have everything under a single ArgoCD project. This limitation could be addressed by adding support for multi-project configurations, assigning each Account Root Application its own project in ArgoCD. This is something we'd like to do in the long term but it's not a priority at the moment.

The _Config_ Git repository contains a tree of different types of `.yaml` configuration files. Each `.yaml` file will cause ArgoCD to generate one (or more) application(s), which in turn render Helm charts into the target cluster.

The `example-config` directory in this repository contains examples of each of these `.yaml` files.

Here is the structure of an example _Config_ Git repo containing configuration for three accounts (`dev`, `staging`, `production`) with a number of clusters and MAS instances. For brevity, the actual `.yaml` files are not shown here.

### Root application example

Register one of these applications per account to be managed by the ArgoCD worker:

> Replace the following:
>   - `<source-repo-url>`: The url of the source helm charts and argo apps. e.g. https://github.com/ibm-mas/gitops.
>   - `<source-repo-revision>`: The branch of `<source-repo-url>` to source charts from, e.g. `master`.
>   - `<config-repo>`: The github repo to source cluster/instance configuration from, e.g. `git@github.ibm.com:maximoappsuite/gitops-envs.git`.
>   - `<config-repo-revision>`: The revision of `<config-repo>` to source cluster/instance configuration from, e.g. `master`.
>   - `<account-id>`: The ID of the account this root application manages. This also determines the root folder in `<config-repo>`:`<config-repo-revision` to source cluster/instance configuration from, e.g. `aws-dev`.
>   - `<argo-namespace>`: The namespace on cluster running ArgoCD. E.g. `openshift-gitops` (internal clusters), `argocd-worker` (MCSP). This determines where Application and ApplicationSet resources will be created. It will also be used to annotate namespaces created by our charts with [argocd.argoproj.io/managed-by](https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/deploy-to-different-namespaces/).
>   - `<argo-project-rootapps>`: The ArgoCD project in which to create root applications (including this Application and the root applications that it generates). The project must be configured to permit creation of `argoproj.io.Application` and `argoproj.io.ApplicationSet` resources in the `<argoapp-namespace>` of the cluster in which ArgoCD is running (i.e. `https://kubernetes.default.svc`). In fvtsaas, this project is currently `mas`. In the MCSP dev worker, it is `mas-argoproj-resources`.
>   - `<argo-project-apps>`: The ArgoCD project in which to create the applications that deploy MAS resources (and their dependencies) to external MAS clusters. The project must be configured to permit creation of any resource in any namespace of all external MAS clusters targeted by this account. In fvtsaas, this project is currently `mas`. In the MCSP dev worker, it is also `mas`.
>   - `<avp-name>`: The name assigned to the ArgoCD Vault Plugin used for retrieving secrets. Defaults to `argocd-vault-plugin-helm`. In MCSP, this must be `argocd-vault-plugin-helm-inline`.
>   - `<avp-secret>`: The name of the k8s secret containing the credentials for accessing the vault that AVP is linked with. Defaults to the empty string, which implies that these credentials have been configured already in the cluster.
>   - `<avp-values_varname>`: The name of the environment variable used to pass values inline to AVP. Defaults to `HELM_VALUES`. In MCSP this must be `HELM_INVLINE_VALUES`

### Deployment Orchestration

To ensure that we sync resources in the correct order they are annotated with an ArgoCD [sync wave](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-waves/). For clarity, we also prefix all resource filenames with the sync wave that they belong to. Note that sync waves are *local* to each ArgoCD application (i.e. each Helm chart).
