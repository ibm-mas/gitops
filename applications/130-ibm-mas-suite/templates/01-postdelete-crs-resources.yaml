{{- /*
 A collection of resources for supporting the PostDelete hooks on ibm-mas-*-config applications
 They are created in this chart (instead of the config application charts) to:
   1. ensure the resources are not deleted by ArgoCD before ArgoCD runs the PostDelete hook jobs that depend on them
   2. reduce code and resource duplication
 ( NOTE: this is a workaround for the fact it is not currently possible to annotate these types of resource with 
   PostDelete due to a bug in ArgoCD: https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/17191) and the fact that ArgoCD
   does not yet support PreDelete hooks: https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/13975, either of which
   would offer a preferable solution to this workaround )
