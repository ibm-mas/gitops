# When ArgoCD deletes the ibm-common-services app, it will delete this, which seems to then break
# any other subscriptions in the ibm-common-services namespace (e.g. cloud-native-postgressql)
# and does not seem to then be able to delete the cert-manage subscription.
# Not sure what the fix is; is "operatorgroup" a shared resource?
