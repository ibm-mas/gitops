  # This means argocd will delete this namespace if/when the corresponding application is deleted.
  # This could be bad, e.g.
  # what if the user specifies a "shared" namespace as dro_namespace? (in fact I think the default "redhat-marketplace" we have for this is one of these)
  # Not sure what the correct answer is here; we can't rely on specification of the namespace in argocd appset.destination.namespace
  # (since that is now shared by lots of different apps)
