Set as the value for the mas.ibm.com/job-cleanup-group label on the Job resource.

When the auto_delete flag is not set on the root application, a CronJob in the cluster uses this label 
to identify old Job resources that should be pruned on behalf of ArgoCD.

Any Job resources in the same namespace that have the mas.ibm.com/job-cleanup-group with this value
will be considered to belong to the same cleanup group. All but the most recent (i.e. with the latest "creation_timestamp")
Jobs will be automatically deleted.

$_job_cleanup_group can usually just be based on $_job_name_prefix. There are some special cases
where multiple Jobs are created in our templates using a Helm loop. In those cases, additional descriminators
must be added to $_job_cleanup_group.

By convention, we sha1sum this value to guarantee we never exceed the 63 char limit regardless of which discriminators
are required here.
