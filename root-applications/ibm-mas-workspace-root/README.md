IBM MAS workspace root
===============================================================================

# Not used at present; we can use the appset pattern for workspaces if we ever add proper multitenancy support
# For now, to reduce complexity and save on (Argocd application count), we only support a single workspace per
# MAS instance (see ibm-mas-workspace)
